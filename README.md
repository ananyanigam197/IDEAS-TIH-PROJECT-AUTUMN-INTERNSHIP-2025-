**Project Overview**

This project focuses on developing a machine learning–based system to detect fake news. It demonstrates the application of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to address the growing problem of misinformation.

The project covers:

* Data preprocessing and cleaning.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization.
* Text vectorization using **Word2Vec** and **TF-IDF**.
* Building classification models such as **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**.
* Introduction to **boosting algorithms** and model persistence.

**Objective**

The objective is to build an automated system that can classify news articles as **fake** or **real**. The workflow highlights:

1. Cleaning and preparing raw data.
2. Converting text into numerical features.
3. Training and testing machine learning models.
4. Providing a reproducible pipeline for fake news detection.

**Tools & Technologies Used**

* **Python**
* **Pandas, NumPy** (data handling)
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (visualization)
* **Scikit-learn** (ML models, evaluation)
* **Gensim** (Word2Vec)
* **Pickle** (model saving/loading)
